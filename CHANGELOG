# oh.sh / oh.ps1 - features and development

In order to have a complete, easy to support and extensible solution to run Open Hospital on Linux, oh.sh has been rewritten, also adding a few possible useful user functions.
For the same reason, a completely new powershell script has been writtend for Windows: oh.ps1 (run by oh.bat).

A short description of changes for the Linux version (mostly the same behavior and options are applicable to the windows oh.ps1 version):

- Complete overhaul of the code, reworked the entire scripts
- Everything is now based on functions and parametric variables
- Menu based, interactive options for many operations: see **./oh.sh -h** (or see below for short description)
- **Unified script** for:
    Portable 64bit (default) and 32bit (with automatic architecture detection)
    Open Hospital client (no more separated startup.sh is needed ;-) (**it is now possible to package every linux distro, client/portable/32 or 64 bit with a single package**)

- **New** **Interactive menu**: it is possible to navigate through menu options
- **New**: Direct reading/writing of OH settings files for language and debug mode
- **New**: Desktop shortcut creation with icon (Windows and Linux)
- **New**: SERVER mode support (see oh.sh -S)
- **New**: Added "-m" option to configure OH database settings manually
- **New**: Arabic Language support: **oh.sh -l ar**
- **New**: Full 64bit support on Windows, also for DICOM !
- **New**: Set default to MULTIUSER environment, so login mask is presented at startup
-----
- Language support (both via variable in the script or user input option: **oh.sh -l fr**)
- Demo database support (See oh.sh -D)
- Client mode support (see oh.sh -C)
- Save (see oh.sh -s) / Restore (oh.sh -r) database, available both for CLIENT and PORTABLE mode !
- GSM setup integrated via -G command line option - setupGSM.sh (https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui/blob/develop/SetupGSM.sh) is obsolete now
- debug mode -> set log4.properties to DEBUG mode (default is INFO)
- configuration file generation (set WRITE_CONFIG_FILES=on in script) -> mysql and oh configuration files are not generated automatically or overwritten, useful for production environment
- test database connection option (see oh.sh -t)
- displays software versions and current configuration (see oh.sh -v)
- save / write / generate config files (see oh.sh -s)
- install / initialize database (see oh.sh -i)
- Centralized variable managing (see related config file changes applied): now all (well, almost all, still some "isf" reference in SQL creation script...that will be removed ;-) references to database password, mysql host, etc. etc. are in the script and can be easily adapted / modified for any need
- More flexible execution and configuration options
- Automatic configuration files generation
- Everything is commented in the code and a brief output all operations is shown in console
- Startup, database and OH operations are logged to configurable output file
- Backward compatible with old versions and installations, no default behaviour change
- Unified and simplified subdirectories structure
- Added sql subdirectory to organize sql creation scripts
- Added various checks about correct settings of parameters and startup of services
- Added security controls (no more _rm -rf_ here and there :-)
- Added support for **MariaDB** for better security and performance
- Windows -> addedd support for path with spaces / special characters 
- Updated MySQL db and user creation syntax (now compatible with MySQL 8 - unsupported)
- Fixed _a_few_ bugs ;-)
