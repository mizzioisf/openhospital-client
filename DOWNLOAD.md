# ![](./oh.ico) OH - Open Hospital Portable | Client 

OH - Open Hospital (https://www.open-hospital.org/en/) is a free and open source
software for healthcare data management. Its portable version allows you to take
along with you Open Hospital and run it on any computer, keeping the data you have saved.
With this distribution we also hope to reach the goal to make Open Hospital easily installable
so that even somebody with no experience of Java or MySQL can try or use it.

Open Hospital can run on any computer and it is easily possible to move the installation on
another computer or even run it from a USB stick or drive. All you have to do
is to copy the root installation directory of OH to your favourite path, where
the program and the data will be kept. OH uses its own version of the Java Virtual
Machine and the MySQL server and everything is contained in the root
installation directory. OH is released under the GNU GPL 3.0 License.

The Linux version has been tested on different distributions and versions,
including Ubuntu 16.04 i386 (32bit) and up to Ubuntu 21.04 x64 (64bit).
The Windows version has been tested on Windows 10.
